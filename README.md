Hey guys, I know that it was blocked for me in arizona (were talking school laptops and how admin is blocking eaglercraft). So if your from Arizona and want to play beta 1.7.3, click  the Beta_1.7.3_Offline_Download.html and download it. Then when its downloaded, extract the zip file and double click the html file. Now it should open in the browser and you can play classic old minecraft again!
